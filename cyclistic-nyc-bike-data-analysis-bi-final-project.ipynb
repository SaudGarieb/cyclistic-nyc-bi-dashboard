    "## 📅 Project Overview\n",
    "This project focuses on uncovering key insights from NYC bike-share usage in 2019 and 2020. It uses Tableau for visualization and public datasets including trip data, weather information, and zip code boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is divided into three main dashboard tabs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summer Trends** — Seasonal trip behavior in July, August, September\n",
    "2. **Seasonality** — Monthly trip totals and neighborhood usage heatmaps\n",
    "3. **Top Trips** — Neighborhoods with the highest total ride durations\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Executive Summary\n",
    "**Business Needs:** Cyclistic aims to understand usage behavior to optimize marketing and infrastructure strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "- Identify peak trip months and popular neighborhoods\n",
    "- Understand differences between casual riders and subscribers\n",
    "- Inform expansion efforts and targeted outreach\n",
    "\n",
    "**BI Methods:**\n",
    "- SQL queries in BigQuery to generate target tables\n",
    "- Calculated fields and filters in Tableau for analysis\n",
    "- Dashboards designed with filters, parameter controls, and drill-down actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- Subscribers consistently make more trips, especially in warmer months\n",
    "- Lower East Side, Chelsea, and Clinton areas have highest ride durations\n",
    "- Summer months show peaks in ride volume and longer trip durations\n",
